DGE categories (food groups)

- We look at how your daily calories are distributed across different food groups and compare them with recommended shares (DGE-oriented).
- How we measure: For each category, we determine the calorie share and compare it with the recommendation. Missing shares (compared to the recommendation) count as deviation. This results in a DGE compliance score (0–100).
- Note: Exceeding individual categories is not penalized separately; it affects the score indirectly because other categories then fall short by comparison.

Macronutrients

- Basis: We sum up your nutrient amounts from all ingredients/portions and compare them with your target values.
- Which macros do we consider?
  - Protein, carbohydrates, fat
  - Saturated fat (upper limit)
  - Sugar (upper limit)
  - Dietary fiber (minimum amount)
  - Alcohol (upper limit – ideally 0)
- How are target values determined?
  - You set your daily calorie target.
  - We derive your macro targets from that (percentage distribution → grams/day). As guidance we follow common ranges and guidelines (e.g., DGE):
    - Protein: approx. 15–25% of energy
    - Carbohydrates: approx. 45–55% of energy
    - Fat: approx. 25–35% of energy
    - Sugar: maximum share (e.g., ≤10% of energy)
    - Saturated fat: maximum share (e.g., ≤10% of energy)
    - Dietary fiber: minimum amount (e.g., ≥30 g/day)
    - Alcohol: 0 g recommended
  - Your individual preferences can adjust these values. We automatically scale everything to your kcal target.
- Scoring (0–100, linear):
  - Target values (e.g., protein/carbohydrates/fat): The closer to the target, the more points.
  - Upper limits (e.g., sugar/saturated fat/alcohol): At or below the limit = 100 points; above the limit = linearly fewer.
  - Minimum amounts (e.g., fiber): Target reached/exceeded = 100 points; below the target = linearly fewer.

How is the score calculated?

- Per day we calculate:
  - Macro score (alignment of your macros with the targets – linear deviation)
  - DGE score (alignment of your food group distribution – linear deviation)
  - Daily score = average of macro score and DGE score (50% each).
- For your plan:
  - Plan score = average of the daily scores.
  - Additionally, a global DGE compliance across the entire period is included (equally weighted with the daily average).

Notes

- The Nutrition Score is an orientation value for a quick overview and does not replace medical advice.
- Portion sizes, preparation, and water loss/cooking processes can affect nutrient values; small deviations are normal.
